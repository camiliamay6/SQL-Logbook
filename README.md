# SQL-Logbook
This repo is log book for my journey to learn SQL (sorry for my bad english :) )

--Update 21/01/2024--

Today i completed 7 problems on Hackerrank, there are [Revising Aggregations - The Count Function](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/revising-aggregations-the-count-function), [Revising Aggregations - The Sum Function](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/revising-aggregations-sum), [Revising Aggregations - Averages](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/revising-aggregations-the-average-function), [Average Population](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/average-population), [Japan Population](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/japan-population), [Population Density Difference](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/population-density-difference), and [The Blunder](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-blunder). From these problems i learned two new function, which are:

1. CAST()
   This function can change datatype of data. I use CAST() function for [The Blunder](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-blunder) problem to change datatype of salary from integer to varchar and back to salary.
2. REPLACE()
   I also use this function for [The Blunder](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/the-blunder) to replace 0 in salary to '' so the 0 will not be calculated for salary.
